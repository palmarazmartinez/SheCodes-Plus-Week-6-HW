# Weather-App

First version of weather application created for SheCodes Plus workshop. This weather application was created to show basic JS functionality (ex: current date and time, Fahrenheit to Celsius conversions). Therefore, no real weather information is displayed. 

This weather app is currently hosted on Netlify: https://fervent-dijkstra-10b62b.netlify.app/
